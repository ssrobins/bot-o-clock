# To use voice cloning:
# 1. Record a clear audio sample (10-30 seconds) of the voice you want to clone
# 2. Save it as a WAV file in this directory
# 3. Update the persona configuration to reference your voice file
#
# Example:
#   - voices/steve.wav
#   - voices/alice.wav
#   - voices/custom_voice.wav
#
# Requirements:
# - Format: WAV, MP3, or OGG
# - Duration: 10-30 seconds (shorter may work but less accurate)
# - Quality: Clear speech, minimal background noise
# - Sample rate: 22050 Hz or 44100 Hz recommended
#
# Then in your persona YAML:
#   voice_sample: "voices/steve.wav"
#   voice_language: "en"
